for Dev Environment:   
in bash, run "$ docker build -t flutterapp ."
    then     "$ docker compose up"
    this builds the container and runs it.

overview: can build a functional flutter app that counts how many times a button is clicked. runs by going to ./flutterapp/app/nathan_johnson_flutterapp/lib.main.dart and running as windows app in VSCode. 
this requires Visual Studio's Desktop Development with C++ feature as well as the Windows 10 SDK located in the feature's optional installs.
